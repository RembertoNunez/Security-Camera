        <p>Hello, and welcome to our python web application that implements face and body detection!
        We are proud to conclude that our project that we set our to build is quite operational.

        What is this project?

        This program allows us to track users body and face in realtime (with the exception of some latency)
        within a web application running off your local machine!
      </p>
        <p>
          About this tracker! What is this tracker and what is its main purpose? This program is a live facial and body detection.
          It's purpose is that it is able to detect and see people in the camera pathway.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the left you will see the tracker working!
          As you may notice this tracker has some latency as it is rendering the image live and detecting live objects.
          We are currently working to reduce latency and implement a program that will allow users to be able to record video off the web.
        </p>

      <h2>How does this project work?</h2>
      <p>This project is a combination of Python files and HTML. This webcam is running completely of OpenCV rather than an embedded JS webcam!</p>
      <h2>That's cool, but why?</h2>
      <p>
      Well the idea to be able to track bodies and faces with a webcam came from some problems with
      ding dong ditchers in my neighborhood. So, we thought it would be interesting to create an application
      that one could hook up a webcam to their machine and track people live within the scope of the camera.
      The program is surprisingly accurate and works fine in low light situations. Security systems typically
      lack the technology to tell if there are people currently in the area, so one may miss someone in the crowd.
      This can cause problems if there is a criminal that a security system was unable to track or clearly point out.
      This program that our team will develop will allow users see all persons within a camera's scope using OpenCV and Python.
      With the application users will be able to use their computer camera to actively track and view how many people are in the stream.
      </p>
      <h2>What did the team learn in this project?</h2>
      <p>
      We learned how to work with openCV in greater depth as well as work with flask.
      These are both libraries that we have never used before, so the project was a very large
      learning process. Timing and collaboration was a huge factor in this project as we managed to
      work on the project a bit by bit at a time and was able to combine our strengths to do a
      significant push every week on the project despite complications.It was a great
      experience to work with new teammates and accomplish the initial goal that we set to make.

      <h3>Awesome job guys! Did you do this all by yourself?</h3>
      <p>
      Well, we did not do this all by ourself as we researched and worked with
      alongside many useful tutorials avaliable to everyone. They are very excellent tutorials
      and I highly suggest that you check them out! Here are the websites that accessed
      and implemented in our project:
