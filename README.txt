Hello, and welcome to our python web application that implements face and body detection!
We are proud to conclude that our project that we set our to build is quite operational.

What is this project?

This program allows us to track users body and face in realtime 
(with the exception of some latency)within a web application
running off your local machine!


That's cool, but why?

Well the idea to be able to track bodies and faces with a webcam came from some 
problems with ding dong ditchers in my neighborhood. So, we thought it would be
interesting to create an applicationthat one could hook up a webcam to their machine
and track people live within the scope of the camera.The program is surprisingly 
accurate and works fine in low light situations. Security systems typically 
lack the technology to tell if there are people currently in the area, so one 
may miss someone in the crowd. This can cause problems if there is a criminal that
a security system was unable to track or clearly point out.This program that our team will
develop will allow users see all persons within a camera's scope using OpenCV and Python.
With the application users will be able to use their computer camera to actively track
and view how many people are in the stream. 

Real World Applications?

*Security guard live feed and camera
*Testing for faces in photos by placing in front of camera
*A raspberry pi live camera that one can mount to a wall and recieve video feed
*Perhaps grabbing faces from the detection and bodies as well
*Good lowlight security for people that are in the dark

What can our team do going forward?

Our team can do many things with this project such as, 
*Implementing a quick capture button on the website
*Implementing the ability to film from the web app
*The ability to store faces and bodies to a local machine

What did the team learn in this project?

We learned how to work with openCV in greater depth as well as work with flask.
These are both libraries that we have never used before, so the project was a very large 
learning process. Timing and collaboration was a huge factor in this project as we managed to 
work on the project a bit by bit at a time and was able to combine our strengths to do a
significant push every week on the project despite complications.It was a great 
experience to work with new teammates and accomplish the initial goal that we set to make. 

What was a huge difficulty in the project?

A huge difficulty in the project was getting the Python webcam and the HTML to both work together 
to display facial and body recognition. We initially thought that we had to use JavaScript in 
collaboration with our original detect.py, however there exists a function in OpenCV that 
allows us to embed a webcam to HTML. After that large hump hindering our progress we were able
to jive through the project and complete the initial goal that we made in our project proposal.

Awesome job guys! Did you do this all by yourself?

Well, we did not do this all by ourself as we researched and worked with 
alongside many useful tutorials avaliable to everyone. They are very useful tutorials 
and I highly suggest that you check them out! Here are the websites that accessed 
and implemented in our project:

Thanks once again for resources that helped take this project off the ground kudos to them!


Once again, if there are any questions or concerns about our project feel free to 
contact Mayra, Remberto, or Jeremy.

That's about all we have to say, I hope you enjoy the program.
Thanks!
